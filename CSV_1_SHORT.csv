relatively unchanged appearance of multiple ill defined opacities and tiny nodules in the right upper lobe follow up stated on the examination from day prior is again recommended new foci of opacification present at the lung bases compared to examination from one day prior likely related to aspiration layering debris present within the right main stem bronchus most suggestive of aspiration as well clinical correlation is recommended recommend advancing ng tube at least cm the current position elevates the risk of further aspiration ct rle with contrast impression comminuted

fragment ct lle without contrast comminuted left calcaneal fracture lentiform area of fluid attenuation at the skin on the posterolateral aspect of the left foot the significance of the latter finding

thiamine folate and a multivitamin his afib with rvr was initially treated with metoprolol then diltiazem his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose his b l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics the patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion during this hospitalization requiring three codes puples to be called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both the patient and the staff the patient was originally sent from the floor to the micu with delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation he required increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor after a ng tube was placed once returned to the floor the patient required less sedation was taken off of any benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints the patient remained somnolent and delerious he pulled out his ng tube he was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor he was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl which was changed to azithro ceftriaxone flagyl he was scheduled to return to the or for revision of his right external fixation in preop holding he was found to be hypoxic and sent to the micu micu course morning of patient scheduled to return to or

respiratory status has remained stable with sp in the high s on room air pt is hemodynamically stable in chronic a flutter called out to floor on no further intensive care needs identified in the micu patient was started on zosyn and restarted on vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status within a few days of returning to the floor vancomycin and zosyn were stopped as cxr showed resolution of questionable aspiration pneumonia this was felt to be more likely pneuomonitis which resolved after the micu patients delirium started to improve but then worsened when he returned to the or for removal of external fixation he developed fevers to f post operatively which likely worsened delirium source of fevers unclear of note patient had recently developed vre in his urine but infectious disease did not feel this was an active infection he received three days of antibiotics daptomycin and then linezolid when these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to lift aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol zyprexa was tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute aggitation qtc was monitored while patient was on antipsychotics and was stable at approximately msec overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use hepatic encephalopathy benzodiazepine use and post operative delririum although spanish speaking sitters and interpreters were employed as much as possible language also likely contributed to persistance of delirium delirium has completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free all haldol has been stopped he has past the period of etoh withdrawal it is recommended that patient follow up with alcohol abuse counseling afib flutter while febrile his afib flutter was complicated by more frequent episodes of rapid ventricular rate this was controlled with iv metoprolol when needed but also by increasing po metoprolol and diltiazem treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help he was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by chads criteria and also because of high fall risk patient was transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on diltiazem mg daily urinary retention patient failed several voiding trials he also pulled out his foley on several occasions causing hematuria intermittent straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of long term indwelling foley however given delirium and aggitation this was untenable this resolved with reductions in haldol patient now able to void freely on his own history of vre on urine culture but no signs of infection dyruria increased urinary frequency there is no evidence based literature or other clinical indications to treat this asymptomatic bacteuria at this time fractures patient followed by orthopedics during admission l ankle fractures treated with casting however

new pancytopenia had complicated course of ampl treatment leukemia patient found to have ampl via bone marrow biopsy the day of admission to the micu he was started on atra and monitored closely for symptoms of dic tls and atra syndrome he was transfused as needed with prbc platlets and ffp he did not develop overt signs of dic he was induced with ara c and daunurubicin his counts responded appropriatly a repeat bm biopsy showed remission and he will continue the atra for now and follow up with dr last name stitle for plans of stage two of his treatment fevers he initially was on vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued he remained afebrile until when he spiked a fever he was cultured and his blood grew strep viridans he was started on vanco cefepime at that time he also had a headache the day he spiked and a ct was done showing what appeared to be brain abscesses his antibiotics were eventually broadened to vanco meropenem fluconzaole and flagyl for the brain abscesses he continued to spike though for approximately a week he complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections they were drained in ir and grew mssa he then developed a pneumonia during his febrile period and was transferred to the icu for several days he required o for a while after being discharged from the icu while in the icu his neutrophil count started to drop and it was worried that he might be having a drug effect his vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover eventually he was on meropenem voriconazole and acyclovir and stopped having fevers a repeat ct scan showed resolution of his pna serial repeat head cts showed slow decrease in size of his abscesses and an mri of his thigh showed retained small fluid collections bilaterally the plan is to complete week course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses we will reimage his thighs with an mri as an outpatient and depending on those results he will either need surgical drainage or still prolonged course of abx he will follow up with id ich pt with multiple small ich sustained from fall with acute left sided head injury in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia ct head revealed small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage no hydrocephalus or shift on follow up head ct revealed interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline shift or infarction the pts neurologic exam remained stable neurosurgery followed closely platlet goal was k a repeat head ct one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses that were discussed above neuro onc was consulted and followed along it was decided not to do a biopsy he also required heparin and then lovenox for dvts and repeat head cts while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds thigh pain weakness etiology unclear and unable to get good exam as limited by pain this may be bone marrow pain no evidence of hematoma or cellulitis no bowel or bladder dysfunction no saddle anesthesia no focal spinal tenderness to indicate acute cord compression mri or the t l spine revealed no evidence of acute cord compression there was evidence of layering fluid likely from the sah although unlikely to be causing the pts leg pain nerve irritation secondary to blood neurosurgery recommended starting decadron on he was not kept on decadron because chemotherapy was initiated eventually he was found to have abscesses in his thighs as discussed above afib pt went into afib while in the icu his blood pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol his high rates were s s he contined to have afib on and off for about a week and then remained in nsr the week prior to discharge his metoprolol was titrated to mg tid for good rate control name ni pt had one episode of b name ni v afib with aberrancy cards was consulted and we did agressive electrolyte repletion and continued the metoprolol he did not have any more occurrences vasovagal bradycardia the day prior to admission while the patient was having a bowel movement he was noted on telemetry to brady to the s he felt light headed and it resolved in minutes appeared to be vaso vagal and he did not have any more occurrences again cards was consulted and they recommended leaving the metoprolol dose the same at mg tid as bb actually helps prevent vagal episodes dvts while patient was in the icu he developed bilaterally pedal edema thought initially to be due to large amount of ivfs because of his new afib though we did ultrasounds and found him to have dvts in r leg r arm because he was edematous and had pain around a new picc line heparin was started overnight but because of his hx of ichs it was decided to stop the heparin and place an ivc filter it was put in place without complications evenutally he was found to have bilaterally leg dvts and then bilateral upper extremity dvts at that point it was decided that he should be anticoagulated heparin was initially repeat head ct showed no bleed and then he was converted to lovenox for outpatient treatment of the dvts he also had a vq scan during these findings of dvt that showed low prob of pe access pt initially had a subclavian line then it was pulled while the patient was febrile in early month only he had pivs until transfer to the icu when a picc line was placed the picc line was removed after a dvt was found in the arm he again had pivs for a while until a ir guided subclavian line was placed for outpatient continuation of his week course of antibiotics a hickman was placed as piccs could not be placed due to bilateraly ue dvts pt was discharged walking around passing pt and going up stairs he respiratory status was much improved and he was not on o and had no sob he was advised not to start work yet and take it easy although he

treated with vancomycin ceftriaxone with resolution of his fevers and improvement of his mental status to baseline without further seizures acyclovir was stopped when hsv pcr returned negative the patient will ultimately need to complete fourteen days of antibiotic therapy for meningitis seizure the patient has a previous history of seizures and has been on phenytoin his previous seizures have not been grand mal but this appears to have been the type that occurred on the day of presentation the likely precipitant of this seizure was the patients infection and fever though phenytoin level was also a bit low initially he was maintained on iv phenytoin then fospheynytoin but then transitioned back to his outpatient po regimen as mental status resolved he never showed signs of further seizure activity and eeg obtained to rule out further seizure activity was not consistent with persistent epileptiform activity allergic reaction respiratory failure the patient had a presentation of rash hypotension and per report swelling of the throat and tongue this could be consistent with acute allergic reaction and the tmp sulfa he had been given for cellulitis is certainly a potential causative doctor last name still it seems unlikely he would react suddenly and this remarkably to tmp sulfa after he had been receiving it for a full day nevertheless he was treated appropriately for an anaphylactic reaction with epinephrine histamine blocker and steroids and recovered respiratory failure as stated before it is difficult to tell if the patient actually had anaphylactic shock leading to airway compromise and respiratory failure other possible etiologies would include pulmonary edema given need for vigorous fluid resuscitation soon after presentation and oversedation in the emergency departments ultimately the patient was weaned off supplementary oxygen without event altered mental status per the patients mother at baseline he has the mental status of a small child with minimal verbal communication skills but he follows commands and interacts appropriately the patient was initially extremely somonolent and then minimally responsive raising concern for non convulsive status epilepticus eeg was more consistent with encephalopathy however and the patients mental status eventually resolved to baseline with treatment of his underlying condition and maximization of other variables likely this was due to toxic metabolic delirium in the context of severe infection history of dvt the patient has a history of two dvts and thus is presumably on lifelong anticoagulation his inr was initially supratherapeutic so further anticoagulation was held then he was transitioned to low molecular weight heparin for systemic anticoagulation while he was npo once he was eating warfarin was restarted and lmwh was stopped after hours of therapeutic inr on coumadin non sustained ventricular tachycardia on the morning of the patient had two brief runs of nsvt that broke without further management this was discussed with ep who thought barring signs of structural heart disease that this likely had no prognostic significance and was likely simply a response to acute illness the patient had an echocardiogram that was within normal limits and he had no further episodes of vt of note this also happened while he was being phenytoin loaded which may have contributed to arrythmia fen the patient initially required tube feeds due to altered mental status and lack of inclination to eat he self discontinued his dobhoff unfortunately and due to a desire to spare another invasive process if possible he was observed and thankfully had cleared enough to tolerate po in around forty eight hours after that he tolerated a full diet with out incident he

hospital course by problem list is as follows septic shock purpura fulminans blood culture bottles at hospital hospital were positive for n meningitidis although near daily cultures of blood sputum and urine throughout the patients icu stay remained negative on admission to the icu the patient recieved a day course of xigris and a day course of empiric stress dose steroids hydrocortisone fludricortisone to treat his infection he had an d course of cephalosporin for meningococcemia recieved ceftriaxone x d then cefepime vancomycin and flagyl he persistently spiked nightly fevers to and he had a profound leukocytosis up to k with l shift culture data remained negative and his only source was a questionable lll pneumonia on cxr bedside flexible bronchoscopy and a bal were pristine so antibiotics were discontinued on hospital day he briefly defervesced after changing of his central venous catheter but then continued to have nightly fevers he recieved another d course of vancomycin cefepime and flagyl empirically when these antibiotics were discontinued his white count had normalized although he continued to have low grade fevers infectious disease was consulted upon admission and followed the patient throughout his hospital stay the patient also was noted to have progressive acral necrosis of his fingers and toes this was followed daily by the icu team and plastic hand surgery and podiatry were consulted there was no evidence of wet gangrene progressive infection and the necrosis was allowed to demarcate by discharge from the icu this had been stable for one week and the patients necrosis remained limited to the distal phalanxes of bilateral hands largely sparing the thumbs as well as the distal phalanx of bilateral feet occupational therapy was consulted to help the patient with this and the patient will be followed as an outpatient or at rehab by ot he also will follow up weekly with hand surgery and podiatry to assess need for amputation versus allowing auto amputation the patient also had diffuse lower extremity bullae and purpura which were cared for supportively with hospital bacitracin as well as xeroform dressings persistent fevers intravenous access was difficult to obtain and access was maintain via l subclavian central venous catheter this was removed in the setting of persistent fevers and ir placed a picc line blood cultures revealed methicillin resistant staph epidermidis and pt was started on vancomycin for day course c diff toxin assay were also positive and the patient was started on metronidazole pt was sent to or for surgical wound debridement with podiatry of the r foot wound cultures revealed pseudomonas and ceftazidime was started for full gram negative coverage acute renal failure upon admission the patient was noted to have a cr bun from presumed normal baseline this trended up to a maximum cr of on hd the renal team was following the patient throughout his stay and thought the renal failure was likely acute tubular necrosis from his sepsis dialysis was considered but the patient never met acute indications for dialysis he was treated prn with high dose diuretics lasix mg iv and diuril mg iv up to hospital for decreased urine output in the context of anasarca however predominately he was treated supportively and from hd his creatine began to trend down and he autodiuresed significantly by discharge from the icu his creatinine had normalized to respiratory failure the patient was intubated on arrival due to respiratory distress fatigue with profound metabolic acidosis initial chest xrays were consisted with ards and the patient was maintained on lung protective ventilation as mentioned above daily chest xrays showed questionable pneumonia versus pulmonary edema the patient was on vancomycin cefepime and flagyl and was also diuresed his chest xrays continued to show significant edema however his vent settings were able to be weaned over his stay he was not able to pass a spontaneous breathing trial and extubation was also deferred because the patient had significant oral lesions and glossal edema raising the concern for difficulty in reintubation the patient therefore recieved a tracheostomy tube and peg tube with thoracic surgery he tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively was quickly able to be transitioned to a trach mask then a passamuir valve over the course of days his respiratory status remained stable throughout the remainder of his icu stay cardiovascular system the patient had several different cardiovascular issues during his stay on hd an echo showed severely depressed lv function with estimated ef repeat echo on hd showed improved but still severly depressed lv function ef this was not repeated during his icu stay he also had one episode of non sustained beats ventricular tachycardia his hemodynamics were stable and his electrolytes were normal at this time however and he had no further episodes of similar tachycardias he was maintained on telemetry throughout this stay he did have elevation of his cardiac biomarkers which peaked on hospital day with a troponin t of his cks had been elevated thought due to his acral necrosis and his ekgs were unchanged the troponinemia was ascribed to his renal failure and systolic heart failure as opposed to an nstemi and indeed the rise and fall improved with resolution of his renal function he should have a repeat echo as an outpatient in weeks after hospital discharge additionally after resolution of his initial sepsis the patient was persistently tachycardic hr usually s s up to s always sinus rhythm and hypertensive sbps up to s s the etiology was thought to be due to a combination of pain anxiety and fevers and a generalized state of sympathetic excess the patient was started on amlodipine hydralizine and metoprolol neurologic as the patients sedation was weaned in advance of possible extubation he was noted to have questionable neurologic deficits specifically he was not moving his upper extremities spontaneously and while he was able to follow commands by eye blinking he did not appear to demonstrate any tracking movements with his eyes as he had been on xigris and also had significant microvascular pathology in other organ systems an mri head cspine was obtained to rule out intracerebral or spinal hematoma bleeds or infection this examination was normal an ophthamologic consult was also obtained to perform a dilated pupil retinal exam this showed diffuse bilateral retinal hemorrhages and outpatient follow up was reccomended his tracking gaze and upper extremity movement continued to improve as sedation was weaned fluids nutrition the patient was maintained on tube feeds throughout his admission initially he had high residuals and therefore was supplemented with parenteral nutrition nutrition service provided useful reccomendations by discharge the patient had passed a speech and swallow examination and was tolerating po intake with his pm valve in place from a fluids standpoint the patient required initial aggressive fluid rescuscitation for his sepsis and insensible volume losses and was significantly volume overloaded throughout his stay although this improved dramatically with forced and auto diuresis and improvement of his renal function transfer to floor the patients renal failure normalized his creatinine returned to normal the patient was breathing room air through a tracheostomy tube the trach tube was removed on soon afterward he was tolerating po food the g tube was removed on the patient spiked low grade temperatures until when his temperature remained below f cultures were positive for the following mrse in blood and wound culture in blood in wound c diff yeast in wound cultures in wound culture pseudomonas in wound cultures in wound culture for these organisms the patient was continued on vancomycin started cefepime to ciprofloxacin started and metronidazole started he will continue to get a full six week course of these antibiotics his foot wounds were dressed daily by podiatry using duoderm gel on dry sterile dressings and xenoform on leg wounds bacitracin on leg bullae his fingers were dressed with dry sterile dressing between the fingers to minimize maceration the patient is discharged to a rehab facility in stable condition for continued physical therapy daily dressing changes and iv antibiotic treatment vancomycin he requires substantial pain control especially for his dressing changes and he has developed a tolerance to morphine his pain is controlled with mg morphine every morning before dressing changes and he has tolerated a sliding scale of morphine mg for physical therapy and any additional dressing changes or examinations of the wounds he is

washout and repair she was discharged to complete a week course of nafcillin date range she was hospitalized with shortness of breath during that admission she was found to have bilateral infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia and superimposed pulmonary edema as well as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage for the pneumonia she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomcyin zosyn and azithromycin for the pulmonary edema she was treated aggressively with diuretics nitroglycerin and beta blockers for the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage she was treated for a short time with steroids complicated by delirium and underwent an extensive autoimmune work up which was negative she was discharged to rehab with l o and furosemide mg po bid while at rehab she has developed multiple complications including delirium acute renal failure fever chest pain and shortness of breath her delirium was thought likely related to medications received a short course of baclofen infection and renal failure regarding her acute renal failure her creatinine increased to from within days after discharge her furosemide and anti hypertensives were discontinued and she was started on ivf

course this is a yo female with history of multiple medical problems including recent right hip infection diastolic dysfunction recent hospitalization with intubation and type diabetes mellitus was admitted with shortness of breath shortness of breath etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure exacerbation related to her recent medication changes and fluid administration pneumonia in the setting of rehab stay recent hospitalization recent intubation and splinting secondary to her chest pain an additional possibility includes pulmonary embolism given her recent hospitalization and immobilization unfortunately she is not a candidate for a cta at this time due to her renal failure and vq scan would likely not be

she continues to c o inability to take a deep breath but ekg is without changes and pt has only slight crackles on exam would recommend pt be kept only slightly negative at osh as her cr remains above

negative the pt is being continued on vanco zosyn for hap the pt needs to be on bactrim s p osteo for months but this is on hold while pt on vanco zosyn this should be restarted after current abx

hospitalization the following problems were addressed worsening renal failure the patients baseline creatinine was and he presented with creatinine of previously he had been discharged to rehab on n lisinopril and lasix and his creatinine worsened since that time renal failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac function prerenal azotemia leading to atn and complicated by ace inbitor and lasix use obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of cc when catheter was inserted and continued periods of hypotension renal service consulted despite efforts to closely monitor his fluid status to increase his blood pressure to sbp to maintain renal perfusion to relieve obstruction by placing a foley and to treat his funguria aggressively his creatinine continued to rise hemodialysis was discussed at length with the patient by both the primary medical and renal teams he fluctuated in his willingness to start dialysis but would not commit to it he developed subtle metabolic acidosis k rose but not above the normal level and he continued to make urine and maintain a euvolemic fluid balance there was no an indication for acute initiation of hemodialysis creatinine stabilized at around by the time of discharge funguria the patient had a fever and a delirium the only source of infection identified was yeast in his urine and

normal with no lad and clear lungs he has been on chronic steroids for several months though so his initial findings may have cleared in this setting in terms of malignancy biopsy of the lung nodules was non diagnostic in the past and the csf cytology did not contain adequate cells to rule this out as a possible cause infectious causes seem unlikley but vzv was positive pt never had clinic

as it would cause the patient too much pain and the patient was not felt to be a surgical candidate regardless in light of her condition and comorbidities her dressings were changed once a day however this was causing her extreme pain despite morphine and ativan premedication and dressing changes were decreased to every three days and then not at all she should not have any further dressing changes as the pain is excrutiating for her anasarca fluid balance hypernatremia ms known lastname was found to be intravascularly depleted high sodium but total body fluid overloaded we attempted diuresis

better hr control in addition there was question of the acute vs chronic pe the echo findings appear to be present in and could be explained by her valvular disease pt had sats of on ra ambulatory sats on ra however pt did experience occasional noctural hypoxia to on ra and was therefore sent home with home oxygen at l nightly for now troponins x bnp during admission oxygenation much improved during admission vna can also help with monitoring for hypoxia pt has a scheduled appointment with her cardiologist and pcp after dc to continue this discussion can discuss whether patient may benefit from an ivc filter in the future atrial fibrillation not on coumadin or aspirin due to chronic gi bleeding the patient is on rate control with atenolol at home mg tid she was restarted on metoprolol given her renal failure and ckd and this was uptitrated to mg tid by day of discharge pt tolerated this well and seemed to have better bps with appropriate rate control bp range s s during admission

on the day of admission she requires transfusion every weeks at the present time work up to date has included multiple egds with argon plasma coagulation which has been unsuccessful thus far and therefore patient had scheduled egd on admission for banding the patient did have drop in her hematocrit during her admission and was transfused unit prbcs a repeat egd with banding was recommended in
